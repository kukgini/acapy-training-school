This repository builds upon the excellent acapy demo project to provide a comprehensive practice environment for exploring agent-controller relationships in ACA-Py. Designed to support team learning and client education, this resource is particularly valuable for beginners working with ACA-Py multitenancy.

# Setup guide

## Register an endorser DID

To begin, you will need access to an Indy blockchain network and an endorser DID with transaction authority. This guide uses the testnet operated by the ACA-Py team.

Please register an endorser DID with a seed at https://test.bcovrin.vonx.io and securely store the seed for later use.

## Configure Environment Variables

Environment variables defined in the .env file are automatically loaded into each container when Docker Compose starts.

1. Copy the environment template to create your configuration file:

```bash
cp env.template .env
```

2. Edit the .env file with your preferred editor:
```bash
vi .env
```
Configure the following required variables:
* `ISSUER_PUBLIC_DID_SEED`: The seed for the endorser DID you registered above
* `SCHEMA_VERSION`: A semantic version string (e.g., '1.0.0') that has not been registered on the ledger yet

## Build Docker Images

```bash
docker compose build
```

## Start Containers

```bash
docker compose up -d
```

## Initialize the Environment

Allow a few moments for all containers to start up, then execute the setup script:

```bash
docker compose exec setup python3 setup.py
```

## Restart Containers

```bash
docker compose down
docker compose up -d
```

Your environment is now ready for use.

# Usage Guide

## Service Ports

The following services are available on these ports:
* **8000**: ACA-Py Agent
* **8001**: ACA-Py Admin API
* **8002**: Holder Agent Controller
* **8003**: Issuer Agent Controller
* **8004**: Verifier Agent Controller

## Verify Issuer Configuration

```bash
curl http://localhost:8003/schemas
curl http://localhost:8003/credential-definitions
curl http://localhost:8003/revocation/registries
```

## Credential Issuance Example

This example demonstrates credential issuance using an out-of-band invitation with an attached credential offer.

In a typical scenario, the holder would receive an out-of-band invitation through other means, such as scanning a QR code generated by the issuer. This example provides a simplified demonstration of the issuance flow for learning purposes.

The following API call will receive and accept an out-of-band invitation from the issuer. The invitation includes an attached credential offer, and during processing, the holder automatically receives the credential. This is a connection-less exchange, so no persistent connection is established.

```bash
curl http://localhost:8002/issue-credential/transcript
```

### Verify Issuance Status

From the holder's perspective, this connection-less exchange results in a new credential and credential exchange record, but no persistent connection.

```bash 
curl http://localhost:8002/credentials
curl http://localhost:8002/issue-credential/records
curl http://localhost:8002/connections
```

From the issuer's perspective, a credential exchange record is created without establishing a connection, as the out-of-band invitation was created without handshake protocols.

```bash
curl http://localhost:8003/issue-credential/records
curl http://localhost:8003/connections
```

## Proof Presentation Example

This example demonstrates proof presentation using a connection-less approach.

The following API call will receive and accept an out-of-band invitation from the verifier. The invitation contains an attached presentation request. The holder will construct a proof based on this request and submit it to the verifier.

```bash
curl http://localhost:8002/present-proof/1
```


From the holder's perspective, this connection-less exchange results in a new proof exchange record, but no persistent connection.

```bash
curl http://localhost:8002/present-proof/records
curl http://localhost:8002/connections
```

The verifier maintains no persistent connection due to the connection-less nature of this proof presentation, but does receive a present-proof record.

```bash
curl http://localhost:8004/present-proof/records
curl http://localhost:8004/connections
```

## Cleanup Operations

The following API calls will remove all the data generated by the operations above.

```bash
curl http://localhost:8002/all/clear
curl http://localhost:8003/all/clear
curl http://localhost:8004/all/clear
```
